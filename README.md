## Search A Listview


</div>

### Description

Searches for any string in a Listview.If you have a list of all the MP3's out there and you want to search for "Bring Me" it'll Return "Evanescense - Bring Me To Life". Thats just an example I know if you have every MP3 then the results would be greater. I used this in an app that I made for my Uncle (MP3 Organizer) Since he has over 7000 MP3's.

BTW - the article is in the project files.
